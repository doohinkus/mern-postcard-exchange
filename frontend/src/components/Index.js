               <h1>The International Postcard Exchange</h1>
                
                <p>
                    The goal of this project is to allow people to send and receive postcards from all over the world, for free. Well, almost free! The main idea is that: if you send a postcard, you will receive one back from a random participant from somewhere in the world. Many professional photographers participate in this exchange, so you may end receiving a valuable work of art! All skill levels are welcome.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why would you want to send a postcard to a stranger? Because, like us, there are lots of people who like to receive real mail, not the electronic waste that passes for human communication. We also enjoy good old fashioned analog photos--digital too, but analog more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The element of surprise of receiving postcards from different places in the world (many of which you probably have never heard of) can turn your walk to the mailbox into a joyous journey - and who wouldn't love that?
