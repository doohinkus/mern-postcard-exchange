                    The first known postcard was a practical joke. It was painted by the distnguished gentleman, Theodore Hook of London, England and he mailed it to himself. How can such a strange piece of mail be a joke? The image Theodore so meticulously painted was a caraciture of his mailman.

                    This project is not about pranks, but it is about capturing the excitment and thrill of receiving a surprise in the mail. On the 15th of each month, the application will randomly pair up participants, allowing each person to view the name and address of their partner and to indicate when a postcard is sent and received. The app also includes a gallery where particpants can upload pictures of their postcards, marking the card's journey on Google Maps.
